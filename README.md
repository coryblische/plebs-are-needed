# ~ Caesar III ~

1. Get UTM [https://mac.getutm.app/](https://mac.getutm.app/)
1. Follow this guide on creating a virtual Windows installation [https://docs.getutm.app/guides/windows/](https://docs.getutm.app/guides/windows/).
   1. If it boots into a terminal UEFI prompt, restart it and hit enter right away when it says "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD..."
   1. During Windows installation, it will ask if you have a key. There's a button at the bottom that says "I don't have a key" or something like that. Click that.
1. Once you get that set up, install Caesar III from Steam or GOG.com [https://www.gog.com/en/game/caesar_3](https://www.gog.com/en/game/caesar_3)
2. If Caesar III closes right away when you launch it, you'll need to install [Julius](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius/wiki/Running-Julius-on-Windows). (There might also be a way to run Caesar III in macOS using Julius, but I haven't tried that yet.)
3. It will probably work. If it doesn't, [you need more plebs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0t3XuiYWGA).
